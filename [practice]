// Algorithm for finding next largest element in an array using stack data structure:

Let input array be 'arr[]' and size of array be 'n'
find next greatest element of every element 

 step 1 : Create an empty stack (S) in which we store the indexes
          and NG[] that is user to store the indexes of NGE
          of every element.

 step 2 : Traverse the array in reverse order 
            where i goes from (n-1 to 0)

        a) While S is nonempty and the top element of 
           S is smaller than or equal to 'arr[i]':
              pop S

        b) If S is empty 
             arr[i] has no greater element
             NG[i] = -1

        c) else we have next greater element
             NG[i] = S.top() // here we store the index of NGE

        d). push current element index in stack 
           S.push(i)
